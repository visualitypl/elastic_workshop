To combat the giant Kaiju, a special type of weapon was devised: massive robots, called Jaegers, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge. But even the Jaegers are proving nearly defenseless in the face of the relentless Kaiju. On the verge of defeat, the forces defending mankind have no choice but to turn to two unlikely heroes—a washed-up former pilot (Charlie Hunnam) and an untested trainee (Rinko Kikuchi)—who are teamed to drive a legendary but seemingly obsolete Jaeger from the past. Together, they stand as mankind's last hope against the mounting apocalypse.","tagline":null,"genres":"Action Science Fiction Adventure","poster_url":"/sCJEwEShZvruTpQ2a4yiX3Q9EyZ.jpg","rating":6.7,"actors":"Idris Elba,Charlie Hunnam,Charlie Day,Ron Perlman,Burn Gorman,Rinko Kikuchi,Max Martini,Robert Maillet,Robert Kazinsky,Larry Joe Campbell,Brad William Henke,Clifton Collins Jr,Diego Klattenhoff,Santiago Segura,Jane Watson,Jung-Yul Kim,Heather Doerksen,Joshua Peace,Mana Ashida,Joe Pingue,Milton Barnes,Brian Frank,Ellen McLain,David Fox,Jake Goodman,Robin Thomas,Julian Barnes,David Richmond-Peck,Sebastian Pigott,Victoria Marie,J.C.

{"id":481,"imdb_id":null,"tmdb_id":"184315","title":"Hercules","plot":"Fourteen hundred years ago, a tormented soul walked the earth that was neither man nor god. Hercules was the powerful son of the god king Zeus, for this he received nothing but suffering his entire life. After twelve arduous labors and the loss of his family, this dark, world-weary soul turned his back on the gods finding his only solace in bloody battle. Over the years he warmed to the company of six similar souls, their only bond being their love of fighting and presence of death. These men and woman never question where they go to fight or why or whom, just how much they will be paid. Now the King of Thrace has hired these mercenaries to train his men to become the greatest army of all time.

It premiered at Loew's State Theatre in New York City on November 18, 1959. The movie's reputation as a classic is primarily based on two spectacular action sequences:  the great chariot race and a Roman naval battle, along with lavish production values and strong performances.  The plot of Ben Hur revolves around a Jewish prince who is betrayed and sent into slavery by a Roman friend and how he regains his freedom and comes back for revenge. However, instead he finds redemption in Christ, the theme is ultimately about being saved in the Christian sense.  The film went on to win a record of eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor (Charlton Heston as Ben Hur). This record-setting Oscars sweep has since been equaled by Titanic in 1998 and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King in 2004, but never broken.","tagline":null,"genres":"Action Adventure Drama History","poster_url":"/syPMBvvZsADTTRu3UKuxO1Wflq.jpg","rating":7.5,"actors":"Charlton Heston,Jack Hawkins,Haya Harareet,Stephen Boyd,Hugh Griffith,Martha Scott,Cathy O'Donnell,Frank Thring,Sam Jaffe,Ady Berber,Finlay Currie,André Morell,Terence Longdon,Lando Buzzanca,Giuliano Gemma,Marina Berti,Robert Brown,Liana Del Balzo,Enzo Fiermonte,Richard Hale,Duncan Lamont,John Le Mesurier,Ferdy Mayne,May McAvoy,Aldo Silvani,Ralph Truman,George Relph,Joe Canutt,Richard Coleman,Antonio Corevi,David Davies,Mino Doro,Michael Dugan,Franco Fantasia,José Greci,John Horsley,Howard Lang,Stevenson Lang,Tutte Lemkow,Cliff Lyons,Tiberio Mitri,Remington Olmsted,Laurence Payne,Aldo Pini,Diego Pozzetto,Stella Rho,Edwin Richfield,Hector Ross,Maxwell Shaw,Gianni Solaro,Pietro Tordi,Raimondo Van Riel,Dervis Ward,Joe Yrigoyen,Nazzareno Zamperla,Jerry Brown,Eddie Jauregui","characters":"Judah Ben-Hur,Quintus Arrius,Esther,Messala,Scheich Ildirim,Miriam,Tirzah,Pontius Pilatus,Simonides,Malluch,Balthasar,Sextus,Drusus,Jewish Slave in the Desert (uncredited),Roman Officer with Messala (uncredited),Flavia (uncredited),Chief of Rowers (uncredited),Guest at Banquet (uncredited),Galley Officer (uncredited),Gaspar (uncredited),Marius (uncredited),Doctor (uncredited),Captain of Rescue Ship (uncredited),Woman in crowd (uncredited),Man in Nazareth (uncredited),Aide to Tiberius (uncredited),Tiberius Caesar,Sportsman (uncredited),Metellus (uncredited),Senator (uncredited),Quaestor (uncredited),Gratus (uncredited),Seaman (uncredited),Roman Soldier Who Brings Crown to Gratus (uncredited),Mary (uncredited),Spintho (uncredited),Hortator (uncredited),Blind Man (uncredited),Leper (uncredited),The Lubian (uncredited),Roman at Bath (uncredited),Decurian (uncredited),Joseph (uncredited),Bad Thief on Cross (uncredited),Villager (uncredited),Amrah (uncredited),Supplier to Leper Colony (uncredited),Officer (uncredited),Rower No. 43 (uncredited),Galley Officer (uncredited),Pilate's Servant (uncredited),Old Man (uncredited),Jailer (uncredited),The Egyptian - Chariot Racer (uncredited),Roman Soldier with a Bow on Galley (uncredited),The Corinthian (uncredited),The Athenian (uncredited)","keywords":"roman,prince,chariot race,jerusalem,governor,politics,epic,friends,revenge,jewish,galley,galley slave","country":null,"release_date":1959,"budget":null,"runtime":212,"themes":null,"popularity":33.099341,"created_at":"2017-09-26T23:13:40.993Z","updated_at":"2017-09-26T23:13:42.240Z","slug":"ben-hur","image":null}
